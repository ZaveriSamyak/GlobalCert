#Problem Statement

The dataset given to you contains images of scanned text which don’t appear to be so clear. 
We feel something’s wrong with them and their quality can be impoved if we remove noise from them.

Your task is to:
-Identify whether it’s possible to improve image qualities at bulk
-Can ML assist us here?
-Which ML technique can help us solve this issue if possible?
-How would you remove noise from it?
-Remove the noise from test dataset
(The training set contains test without noise [train_cleaned])

 You are expected to build a deck which shows your analysis and solution to the problem statement

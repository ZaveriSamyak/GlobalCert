#About the project

Today as the competition among marketing companies, retail stores, banks to attract newer customers and maintain the old ones is in its peak, every company is trying to top the chart. An e-commerce retail store has been struggling with customer attrition wherein they want to analyze the rate at which they are losing out their customers and the rate at which they can acquire new customers by identifying different customer segments and take needful actions against them. Your team is a consultancy firm who like other firms are trying to win this deal from the stakeholders.

#Identifying Bots in Online Auction

You'll be hunting down robots for an online auction business in this challenge. 
Human bidders on the site are getting increasingly dissatisfied with their inability to win bids when compared to their software-controlled competitors. 
As a result, usage among the site's core customers is declining.
To re-establish client satisfaction, site owners must remove computer-generated bidding from their auctions. 
Their attempt to construct a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, such as bid frequency over short time periods, has proven insufficient.
The purpose of this project is to identify online auction bids made by "robots," 
allowing site owners to simply designate these individuals for removal from their site in order to avoid unfair auction behavior.
Consider that the data you would be working with is from an online platform.

There are two datasets in this competition. One is a bidder dataset that includes a list of bidder information, including their id, payment account, and address. 
The other is a bid dataset that includes 7.6 million bids on different auctions. The bids in this dataset are all made by mobile devices.
The online auction platform has a fixed increment of dollar amount for each bid, so it doesn't include an amount for each bid. 
You are welcome to learn the bidding behavior from the time of the bids, the auction, or the device.
